GAME IDEAS FOR YOUR NCURSES STARTER
====================================

Here are some beginner-friendly game ideas you can build with this setup:

1. SNAKE GAME
   - Player controls a snake (@) that moves continuously
   - Collect food (*) to grow longer
   - Don't hit walls or your own tail
   - TODO: Track snake body segments in a deque/vector
   - TODO: Spawn food at random positions
   - TODO: Increase speed as score increases

2. SIMPLE MAZE GAME
   - Player (@) navigates through a maze (#)
   - Find the exit (E) to win
   - TODO: Generate or load maze layout
   - TODO: Check collision with walls
   - TODO: Add collectibles or enemies

3. FALLING BLOCKS (Simplified Tetris-style)
   - Shapes fall from the top
   - Move left/right, rotate
   - Complete lines to score
   - TODO: Define block shapes
   - TODO: Handle rotation logic
   - TODO: Check for completed lines

4. SHOOTER GAME
   - Player (A) at bottom shoots up (|)
   - Enemies (V) move down from top
   - Destroy enemies before they reach you
   - TODO: Track projectiles in vector
   - TODO: Enemy movement patterns
   - TODO: Collision detection

5. DUNGEON CRAWLER
   - Navigate rooms with '@' character
   - Fight monsters (M), collect items ($)
   - TODO: Generate room layouts
   - TODO: Simple combat system
   - TODO: Inventory management

6. PONG
   - Two paddles (|), ball (O)
   - First to 10 points wins
   - TODO: Ball physics/bouncing
   - TODO: AI for second paddle
   - TODO: Score tracking

RECOMMENDED STARTING ORDER:
1. Start with basic player movement (arrow keys)
2. Add boundary checking (don't walk through walls)
3. Add a collectible item and scoring
4. Add an enemy with simple movement
5. Add collision detection
6. Build from there!

HELPFUL NCURSES FUNCTIONS TO KNOW:
- mvaddch(y, x, 'c')    - Draw character at position
- mvprintw(y, x, "...")  - Print text at position
- attron(COLOR_PAIR(n))  - Turn on color
- attroff(COLOR_PAIR(n)) - Turn off color
- getch()                - Get keyboard input
- getmaxyx(win, y, x)    - Get screen dimensions

Good luck! Start small and add features one at a time.
